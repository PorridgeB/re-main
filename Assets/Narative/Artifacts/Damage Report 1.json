Growth-inducing virus was introduced to garden 3H before sufficient testing was completed. The garden grew to extreme size overnight and spread into adjacent gardens.

This is the first time she’s caused a problem of this magnitude, but we had three complaints made against her just last week because she wasn’t following protocol. She may be the most senior Gardener we have but she isn’t worth the headache.","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
