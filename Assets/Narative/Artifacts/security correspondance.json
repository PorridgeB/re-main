Of course, as this is an increased responsibility, you will receive a 2.3% raise.","\n","^Furthermore - in order to further your abilities as an Officer - you have been set the challenge of reducing your Security Hub’s quarterly spending by 2.3%. Failure to do so will result in reevaluation of your increased compensation.","\n","^Please feel free to ask any questions you may have regarding the above information.","\n","^And finally, please note that our Security Experts have assured us that the current speech capabilities of the Droids provide no restrictions to their law-enforcement functions. Please stop making enquires regarding this matter.","\n","^Thank you,","\n",["^William Mocellin, Executives Security Officer’s Assistant.","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-1"}],{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
