Oh, sorry, but you can't leave that way 

* [next] -> next1

==next1== 
We’ve blocked off that door. Inside are the Ghouls of some of the Gardeners who used to work here with us.

* [next] -> next2

==next2== 
It’s hard to see them like that, but they are still people that we once knew and we would rather leave them unharmed. When they’re isolated like that, they don’t pose a threat to anyone. 

* [next] -> next3

==next3== 
I'd ask that you respect this.

    -> END
